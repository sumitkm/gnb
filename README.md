# GNB

## __GNB is Not Bootstrap__
###### Not to be confused with Goliath National Bank from HIMYM   

A small CSS library that has the bare minimum layout stuff.  

Conceptually similar to Bootstrap, only about 1/10th the size atm. Final aim is
to be < 25% of the size of Bootstrap (uncompressed).

GNB is a pure CSS3 library, it has NO Javascript components.

*Built using {LESS}*
